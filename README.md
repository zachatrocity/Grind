# Grind
A windows to-do list app with some flair

URL: https://github.com/zachatrocity/Grind

Brief Summary: Grind is a minimalistic to-do list management application that allows users to manage their daily activities,
 as well as keep up to date with the current weather and their github profile. Our target audience is your average computer
 science student that may find it hard to keep track of tasks.

 Bugs: The Github password is stored in plain text, so it's not extremely secure
 If you multi-select options in the To-Do list and then double click a task, one 
 selected item from the list of selected items gets moved to done each time
